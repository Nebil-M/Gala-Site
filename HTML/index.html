        <h1>What is the purpose of the fundraiser?</h1>
        <p>At LingoBridge, we offer varieties of language services and cultural programs that are designed to provide the needs of individuals, businesses, and organizations. Our language learning platforms are tailored to provide an immersive and engaging experience that will ensure that the users will not only grasp the intricacies of a language, but also gain awareness and insights into the associated cultures. For that we need resources to be able to offer free language services to be able to do our best job. The fundraiser will help us in that respect.</p>
